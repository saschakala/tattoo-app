# TattooApp - Sinatra App

This app was created with the intention of connecting tattoo enthusiasts with the artists who decorate them (because what this world truly needs is one more social media app). 

It allows you to join as a User or an Artist, log and edit details for tattoos that you've received or created, and see profile pages for artists.
